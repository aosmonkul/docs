## Roles and Processing Details

4. Company utilizes third-party artificial intelligence services, specifically OpenAI, to process voice recordings for transcription, along with other subprocessors for various aspects of the Services. Voice data processing may be initiated and held either through your local device application or through Company's cloud infrastructure located in the United States. However, processing by our subprocessors occurs in locations specified in their respective data processing agreements and privacy policies.

## Rights and Retention

Customer is responsible for ensuring that the provision and processing of such data comply with all legal requirements.
