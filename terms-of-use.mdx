Your use of this App constitutes your agreement to all associated Terms. By using the App, you represent that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts and that you are at least 18 years of age. Please read the following Terms carefully and keep a copy for your records.

## App Overview

The App provides AI-powered recording and note-taking tools for meetings and conversations. It offers features for Users to record audio, generate transcriptions, create meeting summaries, and access key highlights without the need for third-party meeting participants or bots. The App includes functionality for Users to download recordings and transcripts, and search through past meetings. 

## Account Creation and Management

Users may create an account to use the App. All Users must be at least 18 years old to create and manage their own account. Users must provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and keep this information updated. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials and for all activities that occur under their account, even if such activities are not authorized by the account holder. This responsibility includes all recordings, transcriptions, and meeting summaries generated through their account. Users must immediately notify Company of any unauthorized use or security breach. Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts at its sole discretion. Users are prohibited from transferring their accounts to any other person or entity.

By using the App, Users represent and warrant that they: (i) Obtain clear, informed consent from all individuals before recording, transcribing, storing, or sharing any conversation or meeting using the App, where required by law; (ii) Understand that recording without proper consent may be illegal, and it is solely the user’s responsibility to comply with all applicable recording and privacy laws; (iii) Will not collect, store, or share sensitive personal data, such as financial information, government IDs, health records, or children’s data, in violation of applicable laws; (iv) Acknowledge that the Company does not monitor, verify, or control the content Users record or process and bears no liability for any claims arising from unauthorized or unlawful data collection; (v) Are responsible for ensuring their compliance with their organization’s data retention, deletion, and security policies; and (vi) Will indemnify, defend, and hold the Company harmless from any claims, fines, or penalties resulting from a User’s failure to comply with data protection laws or obtain proper consent. If a User is subject to special industry regulations, such as HIPAA, GLBA, or FINRA, they acknowledge that the Company is not a regulated entity and that the App does not provide compliance with such laws. Users must not use the App to process regulated data unless they independently ensure full compliance. In the event of a suspected data breach affecting personal data collected through the App, the Company will notify Users as required by applicable law. However, Users acknowledge that no system is entirely secure, and the Company is not liable for unauthorized access, data loss, or third-party breaches except as required by law.

This Section shall survive the termination of these Terms.  

## Force Majeure

Company shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms if such failure or delay is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, strikes, cyberattacks, telecommunications failures, government actions, war, terrorist attacks, labor shortages, power outages, or any other event outside of Company’s control that prevents or delays performance. Company shall make reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as practicable. 

## Termination

These Terms remain in effect until terminated by either party. Company may suspend or terminate access to the App, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without cause, at its sole discretion.

Company may also suspend or terminate access if continued use presents security risks, violates applicable laws or regulations, or results in regulatory exposure. If User fails to make timely payment for a paid plan, access may be suspended or terminated until payment is received. Additionally, Company reserves the right to terminate if third-party service providers discontinue or restrict services critical to the App’s functionality. If Company terminates a paid User’s access without good cause, User will receive a pro rata refund for the unused portion of the subscription. Users may terminate their account at any time by following the designated account settings process. Deleting the App does not automatically terminate these Terms, and Users remain responsible for any unpaid fees. Upon termination, all rights granted to the User immediately cease, and Company may delete all User data, including recordings and transcriptions, except where retention is required by law. Sections intended to survive termination shall survive.
