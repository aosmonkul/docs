As a United States-based company located in Delaware, Company stores your data either locally on your device or in secure cloud infrastructure located within the United States. For users outside the United States, using our services involves transferring data to the U.S. where it will be processed and stored. We implement appropriate safeguards including encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls, security monitoring, and staff training. Access to production data is strictly controlled and limited only to authorized personnel who require access for essential business purposes, such as development and support. You have control over your data and can delete it at any time through the app interface. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, Company considers the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which Company processes your personal information, and whether those purposes can be achieved through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.
